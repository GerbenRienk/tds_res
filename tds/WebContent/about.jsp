			<h3>About us</h3>
				
			<div class="entry-body">
<p>"Us" is at this moment Annelies Rotte and Gerben Rienk Visser. We're living in Amsterdam, Holland 
and since 1996 we have been working as  
datamanagers on 	a wide variety of Clinical Trials. 
(Take a look at our <a href='http://www.linkedin.com/in/gerbenrienk' target='_blank'>
LinkedIn-page</a> for an update on this. And link us.)<br />
All these trials were by academic or non-profit organisations and the trials were anywhere 
from Europe to Asia. The datamangement was done by whatever was affordable and/or at hand: MS Access, Excel, SPSS, MS-SQL server, 
websites using ASP, PHP or JSP and, last but not least, Oracle Clinical/RDC.<br />
Since some years the standards for datamanagement of these trials were raised and 
not only for Phase I to IV trials: many scientific journals demand almost FDA's 21 CFR Part 11.
 Institutions that can afford it use for example Oracle Clinical for this. But for the rest of us there is 
 <a href='http://www.openclinica.com' target='_blank'>OpenClinica</a>: "professional open source for clinical 
 trials" as they so aptly put it.<br /></p>
 <p>Since 2010 we have have been using OpenClinica in various situations for many different companies and institutions. Our activities range from 
 designing <b>CRFs</b> to writing <b>Validations</b>, to <b>interfacing</b> with proprietary systems, to <b>importing</b> data, 
 <b>installing</b> OpenClinica, etc. <br/>
 Furthermore we give short trainings like "Your OC-study up and running in less than 3 hours", but also full-scale
 two-day <b>trainings</b>, covering every aspect of OpenClinica. And of course trainings, tailored to specific wishes.<br />
 </p>

<p>We are very proud that on the OpenClinica Conference 2014 we received the 
<a href='https://www.openclinica.com/oc14-award-recipients-announced/' target='_blank'>
Community Catalyst Award</a>.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about what's on this site, 
or if you would like to hire us for advice about, 
training in or installations of OpenClinica 
(or whatever else you can think of), 
please send an e-mail to
